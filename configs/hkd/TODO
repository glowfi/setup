Improvements
============

* Add option for autorepeat (useful for volume)
	- User can configure autorepeat speed

Future plans
============

Make another tool or modify this one to use libxkbcommon instead of the kernel's
key names in order to support all keyboard layouts, it would not defeat the
purpose of the tool and libxkbcommon is and can be ported to all unix systems.

Possibly add an option to use a config.h file instead of runtime config files,
this would eliminate the need for a parser but would increase the footprint
of the program as most of the stuff would be stored on the stack (it is mostly
negligible)
