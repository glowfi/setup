.SH NAME
hkd \- simple HotKey Daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY hkd
.OP \-v
.OP \-d
.OP \-h
.OP \-c file
.YS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hkd is a simple hotkey daemon that executes commands after pressing certain
key combinations specified in the config file.
.PP
hkd works without a graphical session loaded as it uses the linux evdev
interface, as such it can be used in a TTY. hkd also supports live reloading
of input devices in and out, so newly inserted (or removed) devices are detected
correctly.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-v
verbose, prints debug information and the internal pressed key buffer upon
change acting as a crude keylogger :^)
.IP \-d
dump, used for debugging, it prints the whole hotkey list along with the
information about the hotkeys (matching type, keys and associated command).
.IP \-h
prints help message and exits
.IP "\-c file"
override default configuration file location, instead using the specified
.I file
as the temporary config file

.SH FILES
The configuration files are selected in the following order:
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hkd/config, $HOME/.config/hkd/config, /etc/hkd/config

.SH USAGE
For hkd to work properly the user starting it needs to be either in the
.I root
group or the
.I input
group, this is needed to acces the appropriate system files.
.PP
The config file is parsed as follows:
.IP #
lines staring with '#' are comments
.PP
Every new hotkey starts with one of these markers:
.IP \-
normal matching
.IP *
fuzzy matching
.IP @
alias declaration
.PP
Normal matching means that the keys need to be pressed in the same order as they
are declared, whereas fuzzy matching means that they can be pressed in any order.
Aliases are a name-command pair that can be used instead of commands in hotkey
definitions.


.SS "Hotkey definition"
Leading or trailing whitespaces are ignored, whitespaces between the marker and
the ':' are also ignored, whitespaces after the ':' ignored until the first
non-whitespace character.
The general syntax for an hotkey is:
.EX
<'*' or '\-'> <keys>: <command>
.EE


.SS "Alias definition"
The general syntax for aliases is:
.EX
@ <name>: <command>
.EE
beware that alias names are case sensitive.

.SS "Command field"
The command string gets analyzed and every instance of known aliases gets
replaced with the appropriate command, this also applies for the command field
in alias definitions.

Upon execution commads are expanded using 
.BR wordexp(3)
so "|&;<>(){}" as well as unescaped newlines are forbidden and will result in
error, read the manpage for
.BR wordexp(3)
for more info about the possible word expansion capabilities.


.SS "Keys field"
Possible keys are taken directly from linux's input.h header file, those
include normal keys, multimedia keys, special keys and button events, for the
full list of available keys either refer to the linux header file input.h or
keys.h in this project.
Keys as specified by the kernel are named "KEY_<name>", in this
configuration file only the <name> is required.
Key names are case-insensitive and are parsed as a list of comma separated
strings, such as: 'leftmeta,UP', 'VOLUMEUP' or 'leftctrl,LEFTALT,cancel'.
Some aliases are in place to avoid overly verbose repetitive definitions, those
are: CTRL \-> LEFTCTRL, META \-> LEFTMETA, ALT \-> LEFTALT, SHIFT \-> LEFTSHIFT,
PRINTSCR \-> SYSRQ, MIC_MUTE \-> F20.
.SS "Live reloading"
hkd can live reload the configuration file by signaling it with 
.I SIGUSR1
for example with the command "$ pkill -USR1 -x hkd", for easier use one could add
an hotkey to execute that command.

.SH EXAMPLES
This is a valid config file example
.PP
.EX
# Contents of
# $HOME/.config/hkd/config
@ term: xterm
\- LEFALT,leftshift,S: ~/screenshot.sh \-c
* LEFTMETA,1, D: $SCRIPTDIR/wonkyscript
\- LEFTMETA ,LEFTALT,LEFTSHIFT,S : shutdown now
# term gets substituted with xterm
\- leftmeta, enter : term
.EE

.SH BUGS
.PP
Known bugs are:
.IP -
Child processes
are waited at program exit possibly causing the process tree to hang as there is
no real child process control
.IP -
Upon removing or adding devices the program waits a couple of seconds for the
devices to settle, during this time the program stops working.
